# 2DPlatformer

Based on a [Live Session: 2D Platformer Character Controller](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation/intro-and-session-goals)

by Matthew Schell - Unity Evangelist

In this live training session we will learn how to create a character controller for a 2D platform game which uses custom physics instead of Unityâ€™s built in 2D Physics.

## Goals for this Session

* Learn to create custom script-driven physics for 2D platformer games
* Learn to apply horizontal movement, gravity and cancellable jumping via script
* Learn to detect collisions manually and handle slopes and angles surfaces

## Assets for this session

The assets are already in this repository, but in any case here they are

## Disclaimer

This course was originally checked for Unity 5.6, but I am using a more recent version 2018.3.0b1 (beta). So I am making the necessary adjustments.
